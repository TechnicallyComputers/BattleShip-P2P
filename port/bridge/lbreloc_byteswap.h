 * Performs two passes per bitmap:
 *
 *   1. Restore N64 BE byte order. Pass2 of portRelocByteSwapBlob only finds
 *      textures referenced by an in-file SETTIMG/LOADBLOCK pair; sprites build
 *      their LOAD blocks at runtime from bitmap.buf and never embed those
 *      addresses in stored DLs, so pass2 misses them. Apply BSWAP32 again to
 *      undo pass1's blanket u32 swap. Fast3D's ImportTexture* readers expect
 *      bytes in N64 big-endian order (e.g. RGBA16: `(addr[0]<<8) | addr[1]`).
 *
 *   2. N64 RDP TMEM line-swizzle inverse. The N64 stores textures in DRAM
 *      pre-swizzled to avoid TMEM bank conflicts when sampled. The hardware
 *      XORs the byte address based on row parity:
 *        16bpp / IA / CI:  odd rows XOR with 0x4 (swap 4-byte halves of each
 *                          8-byte qword)
 *      LOAD_BLOCK with dxt=0 loads the data into TMEM as-is (still swizzled);
 *      the sampler unscrambles it during reads. Fast3D doesn't emulate TMEM
 *      addressing, so the swizzled data renders as a sheared/zigzag image.
 *      Pre-unswizzle each bitmap here so Fast3D sees a normal linear texture.
 *
 * Must be called AFTER portFixupSprite and portFixupBitmapArray (which fix
 * the struct fields the function reads), and BEFORE the texture data is read
 * by the renderer or the 4c→4b decompressor.
 *
 * Idempotent: tracks each buf pointer to prevent double-fixup.

 * @param sprite_v   Pointer to a Sprite struct (struct fields already fixed up).

 * Apply per-format byte-order fixup for a chain-tracked G_SETTIMG or G_VTX slot.

 * vertex arrays — most SSB64 model DLs reference both via real-pointer slots
 * that the reloc chain rewrites at load time, not via seg=0x0E.  Those slots
 * have chain-encoding (random high bytes) at pass2 time so they get missed.
 *
 * Workaround: during the chain walk, for every chain entry whose preceding
 * cmd is a G_SETTIMG or G_VTX, this function:
 *   - For G_SETTIMG: walks forward to find G_LOADBLOCK / G_LOADTLUT, computes
 *     texture byte size, and BSWAP32s the bytes to restore N64 BE order for
 *     Fast3D's `(addr[0]<<8)|addr[1]` reader.
 *   - For G_VTX: reads num_vtx from w0 and per-Vtx (16 bytes) applies rotate16
 *     to the s16 ob/flag/tc fields and BSWAP32 to the u8 RGBA color word.
 *     Strict validation rejects spurious 0x01-byte chain slots that aren't
 *     real G_VTX cmds.
 *
 * Idempotent — tracked via the same sStructU16Fixups set as other fixups.
 *
 * Returns 1 if a G_SETTIMG or G_VTX was detected and a fixup attempted, 0 otherwise.
 *
 * Despite the name, this also handles G_VTX — kept for backwards compatibility.
