# Netcode Agent Rules

## Purpose
This file tracks netcode-specific guidance for future agent sessions. It is a project handoff document, not a Cursor rules file, and it should not override the repository's main developer guidance.

Use this document when working on rollback netcode, netplay input, saved input replay, prediction, session ownership, or interactions between those systems and the core game loop.

## Current Netcode Goal
Build rollback netcode in phases:

1. Resolve local, remote, predicted, and saved inputs into a deterministic per-tick input stream.
2. Publish resolved inputs through existing game-facing controller globals.
3. Add deterministic validation for replayed inputs.
4. Add state snapshot/restore.
5. Add networking and remote input delivery.

## Implemented So Far
- `src/sys/netinput.h` defines `SYNetInputFrame`, `SYNetInputSource`, input history APIs, remote/saved input staging APIs, and the battle controller callback.
- `src/sys/netinput.c` owns per-player input source state, resolved input history, remote confirmed input history, saved input history, prediction fallback, and publishing into `gSYControllerDevices`.
- `src/sc/sccommon/scvsbattle.c` routes VS battle input through `syNetInputFuncRead`.
- `src/sc/sc1pmode/sc1pgame.c` routes 1P battle input through `syNetInputFuncRead`.
- `docs/netplay_architecture.md` documents the current input architecture.

## Architecture Rules
- Keep `src/sys/controller.c` focused on local hardware input and N64-style controller behavior.
- Put new netplay-only input functions in `src/sys/netinput.c` and declarations in `src/sys/netinput.h`.
- Do not add remote, predicted, or saved input metadata to `SYController`.
- Resolve input source first, then publish the selected result into `gSYControllerDevices[player]`.
- Existing battle/fighter code should continue reading `SYController` fields without knowing the input source.
- Treat `gSYControllerDevices[player]` as the compatibility boundary, not as the source of truth for rollback history.
- Do not involve framebuffer contents in rollback input design. Framebuffers are render output, not simulation input state.

## Match And Session Lifecycle
- Reset net input state at the start of every match/session before configuring player slots.
- Clear saved input history unless the session is intentionally a replay.
- Clear confirmed remote input history and last confirmed prediction seed at match start.
- Clear last published input so `button_tap` and `button_release` derive from the new match only.
- Configure player slot ownership after reset: local, remote confirmed/predicted, saved, or future CPU/spectator modes.
- Add a battle-local tick counter before full rollback so rematches and scene transitions do not reuse stale global tick assumptions.

## Determinism Rules
- Canonical netplay input is held buttons plus stick X/Y for a player and tick.
- `button_tap`, `button_release`, and `button_update` are derived fields when publishing to `SYController`.
- Prediction should be deterministic: repeat last confirmed input, or neutral if no confirmed input exists.
- Saved input replay should feed the same canonical frame stream into the same publish path as remote/local input.
- Any future state hash should be separate from the input checksum and should cover gameplay state, not framebuffer pixels.

## Current Risks
- `syNetInputReset()` exists but is not yet wired into battle/session startup.
- `syNetInputGetTick()` currently uses `dSYTaskmanUpdateCount`; future rollback should introduce a battle-local frame counter.
- `SYNETINPUT_HISTORY_LENGTH` is fixed at 720 frames. Revisit this when delay, max rollback window, replay length, and memory ownership are better defined.
- `button_update` currently mirrors newly pressed buttons. Confirm whether any battle path requires the original controller repeat behavior before relying on it for menus or non-battle scenes.
- No network packet format, session owner model, or snapshot/restore API exists yet.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Add explicit battle-start net input reset/configuration.
- Define a player slot ownership model: local player, remote peer, saved replay, CPU, inactive.
- Add local input recording helpers that can export/import `SYNetInputFrame` streams for deterministic replay tests.
- Introduce a battle-local tick counter and document how it maps to `dSYTaskmanUpdateCount`.
- Define save-state boundaries for rollback after replayed input determinism is validated.

## Verification Expectations
- Build after touching netplay input or battle controller callbacks.
- Test local device input in VS battle after routing through `syNetInputFuncRead`.
- Test that menus and non-battle scenes still use `syControllerFuncRead`.
- For replay work, compare `syNetInputGetHistoryChecksum()` first, then add stronger gameplay-state validation.

## Packaging Note
`scripts/package-linux.sh` currently includes host DT_RELR handling for AppImage packaging. If Linux AppImage generation stops before creating `dist/BattleShip.AppDir/AppRun`, inspect the DT_RELR probe and avoid early-exit pipelines under `set -euo pipefail`.
